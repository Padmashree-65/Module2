4)HTTP:
a)Create a command that would do a POST request that will return parameters in JSON format
[root@padmashree ~]# curl -X POST "https://httpbin.org/post" -H "accept: application/json"
{
  "args": {},
  "data": "",
  "files": {},
  "form": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.29.0",
    "X-Amzn-Trace-Id": "Root=1-5ea1d8ae-b95417f04070663097bfcad0"
  },
  "json": null,
  "origin": "106.193.1.156",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/post"
}
[root@padmashree ~]#

b)Create a command that would make a request which will set a cookie named foo with the value bar, and return the cookies value in JSON format
root@padmashree training]# curl -X GET "https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/foo/bar" -H "accept: application/json"
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
